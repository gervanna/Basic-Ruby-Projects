# Sub Strings
Implement a method that takes a word(s) as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.

## Built With
Ruby  
*â€” Used the #scan method while looping through the dictionary to check if any string or part of the string matched a pattern in the dictionary.*

## Roadmap
- [ ] Use a database of words rather than a set dictionary
